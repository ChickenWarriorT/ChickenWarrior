Animation Data for 1.15

Notes:
I use this sprite at 60 ms/frame except the whiteout hurt frame which I put at 240ms
This is a new layout that coincides with the long aseprite file in 1.15
I reorganized to allow Aseprite to export metadata to to octonid.json
The .json metadata enables use with Unity/Godot/(GMS?) importing plugins which I highly recommend.
The idle animation is the same for each direction, I thought it would make some graphics maths more convenient to leave the south facing placeholder there.
Seperate left/right frames were used in case someone's engine made HFlipping a hassle.
The subfolder 1.15/Packed/ uses minimal space and is intended for aseprite spritesheet importer plugins or people who could otherwise parse and implement the octonid.packed.json file for use in their project.
